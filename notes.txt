Errors easy to make
- Mixed up ..$bound and $bound.., hard to see error
- Given source abc, hard to see call to $abc when intended $@abc
- Easy to forget to use the name of the outer template in a simple filter \(<=$@.foo> $ !\)

Illogical?
- Should it be \[i;j](...) in array templates since dimensions vary by ';'?
- Using negative numbers to index from the end of the array is a bit hard to read. Also disallows the "trick" of $a($-2..$-2)
  for optional fetches below zero (it works after end).
- Array references should maybe always have [] around multi-value references?
- We should be able to use inline templates as sources and sinks (?)

Bugs
- delete of several array elements doesn't work as expected

Other thoughts
- Use more words instead of symbols?
